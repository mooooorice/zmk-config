Missing keys:
add second behavior of modkey (backspace) to other layers as well?
printscr -> topRight?
delete (right) -> lower layer right pinky?
home, end, page up, page down -> where media keys are, move them to left hand upper layer?
fn keys (add special layer?) -> long-press number keys
Modkey+tab one/left handed? -> lower layer and where caps/escape is (gui esc and gui tab would be next to each other)
make ctr+c und ctr+v a -> left top key, dependend on either shift or if not possible lower layer
Modkey+i onehanded -> longpress i
Caps somehow? -> doubletab shift
Scrollwheel -> raise layer index finger moved right (rightmost on the left keyboard) 


make thumb different dependend on tab or hold -> maybe add alt somewhere?

done :)
